# magicSquare
This code determines if there is a magic square present in a randomized NxM matrix A. 
The user inputs in the size of the matrix and the code generates the random numbers and will continue to do so 
until it finds a combination where the largest magic square exists for the given size of the array.
When running the code, it will prompt you to input in the number of rows and columns you want. 
After this, let the code do all the rest :)
